# selfnumbers
In 1949 the Indian mathematician D.R. Kaprekar discovered a class of numbers called self-numbers.

For any positive integer n, define d(n) to be n plus the sum of the digits of n.
For example, d(75) = 75 + 7 + 5 = 87.

The number n is called a generator of d(n).

Some numbers have more than one generator: for example, 101 has two generators, 91 and 100.

A number with no generators is a self-number.
There are thirteen self-numbers less than 100: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 20, 31, 42, 53, 64, 75, 86, and 97.

What is the sum of all self-numbers which are bigger than n and smaller than n?
